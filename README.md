LIVE APP: N/A

**OVERVIEW**

address-buddy is a piece of software I made that mimics a phone book and can run all sorts of self-explanatory commands. It stores information in a database to persist the data.

**STEPS**

(configure the database permissions in the db/config file first)
1. npm install
2. node app.js (run that in bash)
